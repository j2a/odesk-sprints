odesk-timelog-rework
--------------------

The target for sprint: rethink how time logging for oDesk may work.

Key targets:

 1. Ohmmeter. Time meter should show the time worked right ASAP, e.g. as workdiary.
 2. gotimelog. Make gtimelog and oDesk work together.

Misc subproject: `odesk-auth-proxy` - code which powers the http://odesk-auth-proxy.appspot.com
